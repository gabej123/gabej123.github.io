<p style="text-align:center;">Maine is my home; it's where my family lives and where I go to school. When we moved to Cape Elizabeth I was thirteen and going into the sixth grade and that's about when I met all my good friends. Everything about this state I loved when I moved here; the people, the ocean, the entire atmosphere.</p>
